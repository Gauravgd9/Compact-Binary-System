Recently, many gravitational wave events from compact binary mergers have been detected by LIGO. Determining the final mass and spin of the remnant black holes (RBHs) is a fundamental issue and is also important in astrophysics.Unified models for predicting the final mass and spin of the RBHs from compact binary mergers is proposed.
